	/*Example 7
	We want to draw 20 vertical lines with a distance of 8. The first line has to be at x = 10. So the xvalues
	of the lines will be 10, 18, 26, 34, and so forth.
	These x-values fit in with the formula 10 + i * 8, where i is the index variable: i = 0, 1, 2, …, 19.
	A way to make the drawing is to use a for-statement:*/
			
	private void drawShapes(GraphicsContext gc)
	 {
	 int y1 = 30; // start point: (x,y1)
	 int y2 = 60; // end point: (x,y2)
	 for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
	 int x = 10 + i * 8;
	 gc.strokeLine(x, y1, x, y2);
	 }
	 }
	

}
